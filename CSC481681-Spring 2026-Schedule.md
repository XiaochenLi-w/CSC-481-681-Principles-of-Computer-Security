# CSC 481/681/781 – Spring 2026 – Schedule

The following gives a day-by-day breakdown of topics covered, readings assigned, and assignment handouts/due dates. Each topic includes several required readings that students should read *before* the topic is discussed in class – always look ahead a few days to see what readings you should be doing. Some topics also have supplemental (non-required) readings that students can look into if they want to delve more deeply into that topic.

The schedule in this class is flexible, and past dates will be updated to reflect what was actually covered. Future dates are always tentative and subject to change. Slides, assignments, and the associated reading materials will be posted as the course progresses.
